# CSS Specificity Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to CSS specificity. The bug showcases how the order of CSS rules can be overridden by selector specificity, leading to unexpected styling results.

## Bug Description
The provided CSS contains several selectors targeting the same element.  Due to specificity rules, the outcome might not match the apparent declaration order. Higher specificity selectors (e.g., those including IDs) take precedence over lower-specificity ones (e.g., those only using classes or element selectors), regardless of their position in the stylesheet.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.css` and examine the provided CSS code.
3. Observe the unexpected styling behavior when applying these CSS rules to an HTML element matching the selectors.
4. Review the solution in `bugSolution.css` for a fix.

## Solution
The solution demonstrates a fix for the unintended styling behavior in various ways.  The approach may involve re-ordering and restructuring CSS rules to achieve the intended styling outcome.  Additionally, using more explicit and appropriately specific selectors helps improve CSS maintainability and avoids such conflicts.
