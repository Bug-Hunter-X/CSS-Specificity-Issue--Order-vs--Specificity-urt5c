The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.my-class div {
  color: red; 
}

#my-id div {
  color: green;
}

#my-id .my-class div {
  color: purple;
}

.my-class #my-id div {
  color: orange;
} 
```

The unexpected behavior arises from the order in which these rules are applied. Even though `#my-id .my-class div` comes before `.my-class #my-id div`, the element will be styled with `color: orange` because the selector `.my-class #my-id div` has higher specificity. This is because it combines class and id selectors, which have higher precedence than other selectors.

This error can be particularly tricky to identify because it goes against the intuitive reading order of the CSS rules.  A developer might expect `#my-id .my-class div` (which is listed before) to be applied, but CSS specificity rules override the order of declaration.
